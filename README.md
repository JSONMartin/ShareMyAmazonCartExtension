Ever tried to collaborate on an Amazon order with another person, perhaps a significant other or friend? Have you ever wished there was an easier way to share the contents of your Amazon Cart, without having to move all of the items to a wishlist (and back to your cart) or sending a screenshot?

Well my friends, Share My Amazon Cart is here to help!

This simple plugin allows you to share the contents of your amazon cart with anybody, in real-time. 

Usage is simple. After installing Share My Amazon Cart, any time you're on the Amazon Cart webpage (the URL matching www.amazon.com/gp/cart/), you can press the shopping cart icon. It will read the items in your cart, and send it over to a shared URL that you can send to any number of people. Anybody with the link can view the items in your cart, and even press a "deleted" button to recommend that you should not order the item.

Every time you click the cart icon, it will create a new cart URL. You can also set a desired Cart URL in the options, which will be a permanent link you can share for future collaboration. 

Best of all — there is an experimental “Auto Sync” feature! If you have a Cart URL configured in the options, any time you make changes to your Amazon cart contents, your changes will be automatically synced to your Cart URL, without needing to click any  buttons!

Hope you enjoy, and this project is also open source. Feel free to check out the source code at: https://github.com/JSONMartin/ShareMyAmazonCartExtension

* Note: this plugin does not collect any private information. The only data collected is the public Amazon cart items and related data.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Deleted item sync — when users click the deleted icon through the Share My Amazon Cart app, the deleted item will be highlighted in red on the Amazon cart website suggesting that it should be deleted.

2. Notes — allow users of the Share My Amazon Cart app to create notes and suggest additional items to be purchased
